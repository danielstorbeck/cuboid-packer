# Intro

This is a cuboid packer. It's an old toy project.
I use the following setup:
- Eclipse 4.8 (Photon) (optional)
- jdk 8
- ant 1.10.14
- ivy 2.5.2
- linux amd64

To run it you need the jogl fat jar.
See the README in the jogl folder.

## Roadmap

- translate comments to english
- write tests for the parts I don't understand any more
- modernize code

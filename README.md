# cuboid-packer
A home-grown cuboid packing engine (currently accompanied by a mediocre UI).

Hi, I'm trying to bring back to life a project bit-rotting since 2009. There is a [description](http://www.d12k.org/cubes/ "Yes, a description.") documenting the current state. It mentions three problems: the engine, a UI to interact with it, and a deployment mechanism.

Back then I thought that java webstart was a good solution to the deployment problem but there were always issues. I've tested it right now after a long time and now it doesn't work due to some security issues. Now, I'd rather drop that and let this github-place solve the deployment problem. The UI problem is still a problem because I still dislike writing UIs. Just try it and you'll notice. Maybe you can help me out.

The engine works great (as designed / within its limits) but it's the result of two weeks of unprincipled fiddling, by which I mean that it has no rigorous theoretical foundation.

# What's next?

1. Before I push up things here I'm gonna check if there are any license issues with the JOGL or any other components. If so I'll drop them as well.
2. Push up a working current state.
